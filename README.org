* Scanpath

An R package providing tools for analyzing scanpaths found in eyetracking data.

Consult [[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749596X11000179][von der Malsburg & Vasishth (2011)]] for details about this analysis method.  The manual of the package can be found [[https://github.com/tmalsburg/scanpath/blob/master/Documentation/scanpath-manual.pdf?raw=true][here]].  The package includes a simple toy dataset and examples.

** Install

#+BEGIN_SRC R
  library("devtools");
  install_github("tmalsburg/scanpath/scanpath", dependencies=TRUE)
#+END_SRC

On Linux this should just work.  On OSX you may have to install the developer tools.  I have no idea what needs to be done on Windows to make this work.  It may work, but I havenâ€™t tried it.  Feedback welcome.

** Usage example

#+BEGIN_SRC R :results graphics :export both :file map_of_nine_scanpaths.png
  library(scanpath)
  data(eyemovements)

  # Calculate the pair-wise similarities of the nine scanpaths in
  # the dataset:

  d <- scasim(eyemovements, dur ~ x + y | trial, 512, 384, 60, 1/30)

  # Fit a map of "scanpath space":
	
  map <- cmdscale(d)

  # Plot the map:

  plot(map, cex=4)
  text(map, labels=rownames(map))
#+END_SRC
